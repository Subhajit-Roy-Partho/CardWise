## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep blue (#3F51B5) to convey trust and security, essential for a financial app.
- Background color: Very light gray (#F5F5F5), almost white, to ensure content is easily readable and gives a clean, modern look.
- Accent color: A vibrant, contrasting orange (#FF9800) to highlight key interactive elements like filter buttons and best-offer badges. Orange is a dynamic, optimistic hue that works well in moderation.
- Clean and professional font.
- Use consistent, minimalist icons to represent different store categories and benefits (e.g., a shopping cart for Walmart, a gas pump for gas rewards). These icons will aid quick recognition and visual appeal.
- Prioritize a clean and intuitive layout with clear data hierarchy. Cards should be displayed in a visually appealing manner with ample spacing, using card-like components. Filtering and sorting options should be readily accessible.
- Subtle transitions and animations can be used to enhance the user experience, such as loading animations for dynamic content and visual cues when filtering or sorting the cards. These should be used sparingly to maintain a professional feel.
